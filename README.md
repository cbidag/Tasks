# Tasks
 
All methods are tested with the example in the document.
For the convenience of running the program, all the code is written in one java file.
If take SEGMENT and FUNCTION as objects, all the methods can be easily modified to object methods.
The algorithm for task 1 is sensitive to the order of the two files if the files have different sizes.
For example:
//Running time: 0.35000 seconds (find overlap values in small segment file from big segment file)
//Running time: 0.08000 seconds (find overlap values in big segment file from small segment file, which is about 77% faster)

The answer to each task (based on the data in the files downloaded from https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/hb/static/hyperbrowser/files/task_files/testfiles.tar.gz ):
Task 1: Number of overlap: 45983
Task 2: Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.015550727475411513
Task 3: Mean of the covered numbers: 3.663250386723748
